# CISPO 2030 full-year server status

## Boundary and architecture

- 2025 is an input boundary only; it is not an optimization year.
- 2030 is the first planning year and represents changes over 2025-2030.
- Production is one continuous LP containing all 8760 chronological hours.
- No Benders decomposition, representative days, sampled hours, or temporal weights are used.
- Optional 744h and 4344h leading-hour horizons are explicitly test-only; 8760h remains the only scientific horizon.

## Implemented

- 31 provinces and 36,686 VRE technology-site rows at 0.25-degree resolution.
- Exact 2023 hourly CF linkage with sparse coefficient construction.
- Continuous capacity-based RUC and cyclic annual commitment/ramp state.
- Battery/PHS SOC and reserve; station-level hydropower and reservoir balance.
- 411 interprovincial corridors, strict hourly power balance, reserve and inertia.
- DAC, annual carbon and biomass accounts, CCS capture and point-level injection.
- Spur/trunk/substation augmentation, memory gate, numerical diagnostics and IIS.
- Production load centers are the 278-node Natural Earth paper replication.
- Annual center energy allocation, provincial export closure and 517-edge intra-province AC500 expansion layer.
- Hydropower station-to-substation/load-center routing and hydro spur/trunk augmentation.

## Verification snapshot

- Current validated code commit: `8e49a87` (`fix: harden CCS and station-level hydropower model`).
- Current validated server data paths:
  - `CISPO_DATA_ROOT=/data/zz2/National_model/data/model_ready_20260706_station_hydro`
  - `CISPO_HYDRO_ROOT=/data/zz2/National_model/data/hydro_timeseries_20260706_station_hydro`
  - `CISPO_RAW_GRFR_ROOT=/data/zz2/National_model/data/grfr_raw_2019`
- Raw GRFR transfer completed on 2026-07-06 and was verified on the server:
  - `output_pfaf_03_2019.nc`: 3,380,260,808 bytes, SHA256 `84ff2c882fb17a4b8693bb0773718c2472038021b64618b05f99f8070a506e0f`.
  - `output_pfaf_04_2019.nc`: 5,445,519,752 bytes, SHA256 `e56d5da855ddbdafabdafcb5582981b3f0003054156cf8d912d24a9efd232756`.
- Server readiness with `--require-raw-grfr --verify-raw-grfr-sha256`: `PASS`, zero hard failures.
- Hydropower station input: 2,030 rows, 620 reservoir rows, 1,410 run-of-river rows, 0 potential paper-rule mismatches, no missing required columns.
- Server regression test: 15/15 tests passed with pytest in 20.75 seconds.
- One-month server preflight: 4,300,620 variables, 6,004,434 constraints, 74,591,808 nonzeros; estimated model memory 4.19 GiB; memory gate passed with 110.24 GiB available.
- Full-year server preflight: 48,164,172 variables, 68,689,554 constraints, 862,195,872 nonzeros.
- Conservative full-year model-memory estimate: 47.98 GiB; configured `SoftMemLimit`: 80 GiB.
- Local 744h build-only test: 3,032,784 variables, 4,760,844 constraints, 39,084,173 nonzeros; completed in about 134 seconds without optimization.
- Local 24h smoke solve: 365,184 variables, 285,309 constraints and 1,812,785 nonzeros; continuous LP solved to optimality in about 8 seconds after presolve. Maximum center-balance and province-export residuals were `1.16e-13` and `1.14e-13` GWh; no edge flowed in both directions, DPV spur augmentation was exactly zero, and no intra-capacity constraint was violated.
- Six-month/full-year local preflight correctly reported that the 32/64 GiB memory gates were not met; no construction was attempted.
- Server: 96 logical CPUs, 125 GiB RAM, 4.3 TiB free under `/data`.
- Server Gurobi Optimizer and `gurobipy`: 13.0.2 installed under `/home/zz2/opt/gurobi1302/linux64` and `/home/zz2/.local/envs/cispo-2030` respectively; 12.0.1 remains available as rollback software.
- Server license: retrieved successfully with Gurobi 13.0.2 on 2026-07-03, stored at `/home/zz2/gurobi.lic`, and valid through 2027-07-02. The server-issued license ID is 2840423.
- Production-license gate passed on 2026-07-06: Gurobi 13.0.2 solved the deterministic 2,501-variable LP to optimality with objective `1.0`, confirming that the bundled size-limited fallback is not active. This gate is also enforced by `scripts/check_server_readiness.py`.

## Explicit unresolved inputs

- CSP site potential and hourly profiles; CSP remains disabled.
- Observed province-level 2025 PHS floor; current floor is explicitly zero.
- Thermal online fuel term `f_on`; fuel is charged on gross generation only.
- Hydropower type labels include low-confidence assigned labels because source data do not provide reliable type labels for all stations; retain them for now and validate later against external station evidence.
- Capacity credits, inertia threshold and spur/trunk proxy costs still need parameter-source review, but no sensitivity-test workflow is requested for the current milestone.
- Intra-center annual capacity uses a 50% design utilization assumption; two western AC500 proxy edges exceed the 1000 km source range.
- Intra-center losses remain zero until their annual energy can be fed back into the provincial hourly balance.

The only production entry is `scripts/run_cispo_2030_full_year.py`.
